Arin Vale was born in a coastal town where the sea decided the fate of every household. His father was a fisherman who believed storms were tests of character, and his mother kept time by the tides. When Arin was twelve, a sudden tempest took his father’s boat and never returned it. From that day, the sea became both his enemy and his teacher.

Forced to grow up quickly, Arin worked at the docks, repairing nets and listening to sailors’ stories. He learned how fear sounded in a man’s voice and how hope hid between pauses. At night, he taught himself navigation by stolen glances at old maps and broken compasses. What he lacked in formal learning, he made up for with patience and sharp observation.

Years later, when pirates began preying on merchant ships, Arin volunteered as a guide through dangerous waters. He didn’t fight with brute strength; he fought with foresight, predicting currents and ambushes before they formed. Yet guilt followed him like a shadow—every calm voyage reminded him of the one storm he couldn’t foresee.

Arin’s true goal was never glory or wealth. He sought understanding: to learn whether fate could be read like tides, or if some losses were simply written into the horizon.
