Noor Althea was raised between journeys, never long enough in one place to call it home. Her parents were cartographers who mapped roads that no longer appeared on official charts—trade paths abandoned after borders shifted, villages erased by time rather than war. As a child, Noor learned that what vanished from maps rarely vanished from memory.

When her parents disappeared during an expedition, authorities called it an accident. Noor suspected neglect. Routes once vital had been deemed unimportant, and so were the people who knew them. Left alone, she inherited notebooks filled with hand-drawn lines, symbols, and warnings written in the margins.

Noor grew into a quiet researcher, working in archives and transit offices, piecing together forgotten connections. She discovered that lost routes were often reused—for smuggling, espionage, or escape. Knowledge, she realized, was never neutral; it waited for the right moment.

Though offered safer work, Noor chose uncertainty. She guided refugees, couriers, and investigators through paths others overlooked. She never asked names and never gave her own. Trust was built on direction, not identity.

Noor Althea believed the world was not defined by borders, but by passages. And as long as someone remembered how to move through silence, nothing was ever truly lost.
