Tullio Hermil was raised to believe desire justified itself. Privileged, admired, and intellectually refined, he never learned restraint—only entitlement. Society rewarded his charm and ignored his cruelty, shaping a man who confused passion with right.

His moral failure did not come suddenly; it was cultivated. Each indulgence weakened his empathy, until love became possession. Tullio’s tragedy is not ignorance but self-awareness without accountability. He understands his guilt but refuses justice, believing himself beyond human law.

His backstory reveals a man destroyed not by society’s rules, but by society’s indulgence.
