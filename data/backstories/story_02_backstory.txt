Margaret Hale was born on the edge of the moor, where fog swallowed sound and superstition traveled faster than news. Her family had lived there for generations, caretakers of land no one else wanted. From childhood, Margaret learned to read weather, animal behavior, and silence itself.

When villagers whispered of curses and phantom beasts, Margaret listened—but did not believe. She had seen how fear bent stories into monsters. Still, she respected the moor’s power. It hid truths as easily as it revealed them.

After her parents died, she became the quiet intermediary between outsiders and locals. People trusted her because she neither mocked their beliefs nor fed them. She understood that fear was often rooted in grief.

Margaret kept records—footprints, sightings, patterns—while others clutched legends. She believed mysteries had explanations, but that explanations required patience. The moor was not evil, she thought, only indifferent.

In a land ruled by shadows and echoes, Margaret Hale stood as proof that calm observation could outlast even the darkest myth.
